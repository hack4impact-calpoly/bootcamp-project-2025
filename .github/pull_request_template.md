## Developer: Will Heath

Milestone 1

### Pull Request Summary

I have completed all criteria for milestone 1 and am ready for review. One thing to note:

*I started this project using next.js and later realized I need to use vanilla ts.
Because of this, I had to clear a ton of commits on main (previous commits can be seen in dev branch). 
Despite this, some external packages remained (react stuff etc.), making compiling vanilla ts
much more difficult than it should be. 
There are tsconfig files for each ts file to compile it because of this (throws errors otherwise).
Commit history may be a tiny bit scuffed because of this.
The blogs[] is duplicated because leftover packages are interfering 
with ts compilation, specifically it does not like the export statement. 

index.html is not in src folder in order for GitHub Pages to work.

(Sorry for this long summary, just a lot to explain)
